***************************************

**Other note**
For years 2009 to 2012, there is a folder named
"Median Income 5-Year Estimate_20--"
Be sure to read 'Tables:' in the file
"nhgis0005_ds191_..._blck_grp_E_codebook.txt"
In order to properly understand the csv file.
Unlike years 2013 and 2014 were
Median Household Income and
Median Household Income *ethnic specific*
are given their own seperate csv files,
From years 2009 to 2012 tables
Median Household Income and
Median Household Income *ethnic specific*
are on the same single csv file.
Just a heads up when reformatting the csv files.
